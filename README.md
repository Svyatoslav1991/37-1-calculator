Task 1. Graphic calculator
What should be done
Implement a graphical application for basic operations with integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

At the top of the application window there are two text fields for entering two numbers.
Just below is a field displaying the result.
Further below are buttons for the four main actions: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
The interface should be freely scalable depending on the size of the window itself.

If some operation cannot be performed due to incorrect data, the text “ERROR” is written in the result field.
